# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Using-Python-Streamlit-Webapp
A web application for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models. This project includes prediction models for diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Heart disease.

## **About**
The diseases currently supported by this web app include:
- Diabetes
- Parkinson's disease
- Heart disease

## **Models**

The machine learning models used in this web app are trained on publicly available datasets specific to each disease. Here is a brief description of each model:

- Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

- Parkinson's Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease in a person based on features extracted from voice recordings.

- Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.
